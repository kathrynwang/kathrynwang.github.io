# Welcome to katsthread!

### ***The fashion industry accounts for 10% of the world's carbon emissions.***

*katsthread* is a project I began in May 2020 to engage those in my community to think consciously about their clothing purchases and the impact that fast fashion has on our world. I started teaching myself to sew in January 2020, inspired by the creative "thrift flips" I had seen on the internet. I began sorting through old clothing in my closet to find pieces I could transform into modern styles. In addition, I have decided to minimize my clothing purchases, and only purchase thrifted orsustainably-produced items. I also share resources and graphics focused on sustainability to raise awareness on a variety of environment-related issues.
